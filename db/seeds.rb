# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# create_table "places", force: :cascade do |t|
#     t.string   "name"
#     t.string   "address"
#     t.string   "state_code"
#     t.string   "postal_code"
#     t.integer  "rating"
#     t.string   "hours"
#     t.string   "price"
